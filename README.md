Unit vs Integration test example


## Introduction
The problem set out in this repository is aimed at highlghting 
the different aspects of the software that can be tested by a **unit** test
and an **integration** test. 

## Problem
While out on a run I struck up a conversation with Norman, my imaginary friend,
with Valentines day around the corner he was looking for a way to arrange the
perfect date for his imaginary girlfriend Norma. He had a few ideas but decided
to write some code to arrange the perfect combination.

## Challenge
 - First write the unit tests for the *LoveMachine* to ensure that it
 is accessing its dependencies accordingly.
 - Write an integration test and integration test to evaluate Norman's
dream date. His plan is to arrange a candle lit dinner with fine wine, 
romantic music and witty conversation before heading out for a walk on the
beach and finish with some star gazing. Oh and don't forget to invite Norma.

## Incentive
The integration test should give you a value for the plans chance of success,
there are some treats on my desk in exchange for the correct chance of 
success value (or at least a valiant effort).
There is an example of the unit and integration tests in the solution folder.
If there are any questions feel free to ask.
